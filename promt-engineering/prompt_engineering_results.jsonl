Syntax:**\n\n```python\nprint(variable, end=\"\")\n```\n\n* `variable` is the data you want to print.\n* `end` is an optional argument that specifies the final character to be printed before a newline character is added.\n\n**2. Newline character:**\n\n* By default, the `print()` function adds a newline character after the printed variable.\n* You can use the `end` argument to specify a different character or no character at all.\n\n**3. Arguments:**\n\n* `print()` can take multiple arguments, which will be separated by commas.\n* Each"}

{"question": "Why does my list not grow when I assign instead of append?", "expected_answer": "Use append() to add elements:\n\n```python\nmy_list = []\nmy_list.append(1)\n```", "model_answer": "You are a helpful Python programming assistant.\n\nQuestion: Why does my list not grow when I assign instead of append?\nAnswer: The list does grow when you assign instead of append, but it does not grow when you append because the list is assigned a new reference to the same underlying list.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the difference between append and assign:\n\n**Append:**\n* Adds a new element to the end of the list.\n* The new element is assigned a new reference to the existing list.\n* The original list remains unchanged.\n\n**Assign:**\n* Assigns a new list to the variable.\n* The new list is not added to the existing list.\n* The original list remains unchanged.\n\nIn your case, you are using the `assign` keyword to assign a new list to the variable.

{"question": "Why can I change a list but not a string?", "expected_answer": "Lists are mutable; strings are not.
